[allenlsy](http://allenlsy.com)'s oh-my-zsh configuration. I use `ys` theme, and I added `ruby` and `node` version to `PROMPT`.

## Get started

Please backup your `~/.oh-my-zsh` folder before doing so.

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/allenlsy/.oh-my-zsh

Please Refer to my `.zshrc` file in [my dotfiles](https://github.com/allenlsy/dotfiles) on github.
